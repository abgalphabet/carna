# Carna and Kata

## About Kata
>*[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming))*

>A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition. The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer,[1] in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published 21 different katas.[2]

I start this project as a coding gym to achieve following goals:

1. Practice the problem solving skills
1. Practice functional programming skills
1. Apply algorithms in real life problems
1. Chanllenge myself

I start out to solve the [Google Code Jam past problems](https://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html) which I wanna try out for a long time.
